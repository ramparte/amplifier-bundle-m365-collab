## Quick Start

**Dispatch a task:**
```
"Ask Buckaroo to design the architecture for X"
"Have Perfect Tommy implement the caching layer"
"Get New Jersey to research Y"
```

**Check responses:**
```
"What did they say?"
"Any responses from the team?"
```

**List agents:**
```
"Who's available?"
```

The team is ready. Just tell me what you need done!
